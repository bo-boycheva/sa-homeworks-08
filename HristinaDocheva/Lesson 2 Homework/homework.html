                <p>More screen means more space to do great things. Go big with the Galaxy Note8's 6.3" screen. It's the largest ever screen on a Note device and it still fits easily in your hand. Use the S Pen to express yourself in ways that make a difference. Draw your own emojis to show how you feel or write a message on a photo and send it as a handwritten note. Do things that matter with the S Pen.</p>

                <p>Get crisp photos even when it's dark and it's difficult to keep your phone steady. The Galaxy Note8's dual camera has a wide-angle camera that comes with the great low-light capabilities that you've come to expect from Galaxy phones. The dual camera supports 2x optical zoom so you get sharp photos or videos even from a distance, and both cameras have optical image stabilization so you get steady shots even when zoomed in.</p>
